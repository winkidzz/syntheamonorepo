Here's a breakdown of the information from the provided document:

**Overall Report:**

*   **Lab:** Integrated Genetics
*   **Test:** Chromosome Amnio RFX CMA
*   **Specimen Type:** Amniotic Fluid

**Patient Information:**

*   **Patient Name:** Sample Report, 052104
*   **Date of Birth:** 06/12/1985
*   **Gender:** F (Female)
*   **Patient ID:** YU16-73624 A

**Results:**

*   **Cells Counted:** 15
*   **Colonies Counted:** 15
*   **Cells Analyzed:** 15
*   **Cytogenic Result:** 46,XX (Normal Female Karyotype)
*   **Cells Karytyped:** 2
*   **Band Resolution:** 450

**Interpretation & Disclaimer:**

*   “Cytogenetic analysis of cultured amniocytes has revealed a NORMAL female karyotype with an apparently normal GTG banding pattern in all in-situ colonies or subcultured metaphases analyzed.”
*   “This result does not exclude the possibility of subtle rearrangements below the resolution of cytogenetics or congenital anomalies.”

**Personnel:**

*   **Under K. Gadi, PhD, FACMG** (Board Certified Cytogeneticist)
*   **Arunidhati Chatterjee, MD** (Medical Director)
*   **Peter Papenhause, PhD** (National Director of Cytogenetics)

**Address:**
1904 TW Alexander Drive, RTP, NC, 27709-0183 (800) 345-4363

**Note:** This is a standard cytogenetic report. The 46,XX result indicates that the patient has two normal X chromosomes, which is typical. The disclaimer highlights that even with this seemingly normal result, other chromosomal or genetic abnormalities could still be present that wouldn't be detected by this specific test.
